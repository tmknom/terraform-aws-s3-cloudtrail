  # Rules for Bucket Naming
  #   - Bucket names must be unique across all existing bucket names in Amazon S3.
  #   - Bucket names must comply with DNS naming conventions.
  #   - Bucket names must be at least 3 and no more than 63 characters long.
  #   - Bucket names can contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
  #   - Bucket names must not contain uppercase characters or underscores.
  #   - Bucket names must start with a lowercase letter or number.
